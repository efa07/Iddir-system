# 🇪🇹 Iddir Digital Platform

**Modernizing Ethiopia’s Traditional Social Safety Net**

## 📌 Overview

Iddir is one of Ethiopia’s most enduring indigenous community institutions, built on mutual aid, trust, and social cohesion. This project aims to **digitize and modernize the traditional Iddir system** while preserving its cultural values.

The platform enables Iddir groups to manage members, contributions, emergency support, and community initiatives digitally — improving transparency, efficiency, and accessibility.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional Iddirs face several modern challenges:

- Manual record keeping and cash handling  
- Limited transparency and accountability  
- Difficulty scaling beyond local communities  
- No digital contribution or support history  
- Low engagement from younger, tech-savvy members  

This project addresses these issues through a secure, user-friendly digital system tailored for Ethiopian Iddirs.
